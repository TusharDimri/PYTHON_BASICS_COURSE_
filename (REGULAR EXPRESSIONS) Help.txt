Meta Characters
[] A set of characters.For Example:-[ab] will match for a or b in a place.Similarly[-.] will look for - and .
\ Signals a special sequence (can also be used to escape special characters)
. Any character (except newline character)
^ Beginning of a String,But if used as [^abc] it matches everything tha is Not abc
$ Ending of a String

Quantifiers
* Zero or more occurrences
+ One or more occurrences
{} Exactly the specified number of occurrences.Range of numbers,say {1,4} where 1 is minimum and 4 is maximum
| Either or
() Capture and group

Special Sequences
\A Returns a match if the specified characters are at the beginning of the string
\b Returns a match where the specified characters are at the beginning or at the end of a word.For Example:- r"ain\b"
checks if word in our string ends with ain
\B Returns a match where the specified characters are present, but NOT at the beginning (or at the end) of a word


\d Returns a match where the string contains digits (numbers from 0-9)
\D Returns a match where the string DOES NOT contain digits
\s Returns a match where the string contains a white space character(space, tab, newline)
\S Returns a match where the string DOES NOT contain a white space character
\w Returns a match where the string contains any word characters (characters from a to Z, digits from 0-9, and the underscore _ character)
\W Returns a match where the string DOES NOT contain any word characters
\Z Returns a match if the specified characters are at the end of the string

Note :- While searching for meta characters(as normal characters) in our string we need to escape them as :-
\metacharacter(say '.' is escaped as \.)
Also, as we can clearly see, the capital letters negate what small letters mean.For example:-
\d :- Matches Digits
\D :- Matches anything except a digit
