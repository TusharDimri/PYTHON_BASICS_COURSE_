Breaking a task into small subtasks referred to as ABSTRACTION(these subtasks can then be integrated to complete that task).For Example
:- Assembling a Car,where different parts made by different(maybe same) manufactures are used to get one final product, a car in this case

In OOPS ENCAPSULATION is used to achieve ABSTRACTION.IN simple words ENCAPSULATION refers to the process of hiding implementation details
(Laptop for example) As the hindi saying goes,"aam khayen guthliya na gine" is the perfect way to to explain ENCAPSULATION i.e. rather than
going in depth in the working of an Abstracted task, we simply apply it for the purpose of its creation.Coming back to the example of assem
-ly of a car,the parts used are assembled without going into complete depth(or a little) of the different parts used i.e. during assembly
one has to follow only the working rules required for assembling without complete knowledge of how engine is made.
